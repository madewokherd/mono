Because this takes me forever to figure out every time I have to work with marshaling, here is the meaning of every MarshalAction constant.

MARSHAL_ACTION_CONV_IN:

Converts a managed value to an unmanaged value that can later be pushed on the stack. May create a local variable and return its index, which will be passed to other actions via conv_arg.

argnum = index of an argument containing the managed value
conv_arg = 0
conv_arg_type = out parameter, used to return the type of this argument in the unmanaged function signature

MARSHAL_ACTION_PUSH:

Push an unmanaged value from MARSHAL_ACTION_CONV_IN onto the stack.

argnum = index of an argument containing the managed value
conv_arg = return value from MARSHAL_ACTION_CONV_IN
conv_arg_type = NULL

MARSHAL_ACTION_CONV_RESULT:

Convert the return value of an unmanaged function, currently on the stack, to a managed value. Store the managed value in local with index 3.

NOTE: emit_native_wrapper_ilgen may not call mono_emit_marshal depending on the type.

argnum = 0
conv_arg = 0
conv_arg_type = NULL

MARSHAL_ACTION_CONV_OUT:

Convert an unmanaged output argument value to a managed value.

NOTE: emit_native_wrapper_ilgen may not call mono_emit_marshal depending on the type.

argnum = index of an argument that will accept the managed value
conv_arg = return value from MARSHAL_ACTION_CONV_IN
conv_arg_type = NULL

MARSHAL_ACTION_MANAGED_CONV_IN:

Convert an unmanaged input value to a managed input value. Returns the index of a local that contains the managed input value. The contents of this local (or the address in the case of a byref argument) will be passed directly to the managed method.

NOTE: emit_managed_wrapper_ilgen may not call mono_emit_marshal depending on the type.

argnum = index of an argument containing the unmanaged value
conv_arg = 0
conv_arg_type = out parameter, accepts a type for this argument in the unmanaged signature

MARSHAL_ACTION_MANAGED_CONV_RESULT:

Convert the return value of a managed function, currently on the stack, to an unmanaged value. Store the unmanaged value in local with index 3.

NOTE: emit_managed_wrapper_ilgen may not call mono_emit_marshal depending on the type.

argnum = 0
conv_arg = 0
conv_art_type = NULL

MARSHAL_ACTION_MANAGED_CONV_OUT:

Convert a managed output argument value to an unmanaged value.

argnum = index of an argument that will accept the unmanaged value
conv_arg = return value from MARSHAL_ACTION_MANAGED_CONV_IN, which is the index of a local that now contains the managed value
conv_arg_type = NULL
